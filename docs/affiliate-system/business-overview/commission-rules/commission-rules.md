# Provider Fees

This guide explains how Komashi pricing works for service providers, including the free usage tier and the tier-based fee calculation model.

---

## 1. Free Usage Tier – 10 Invoices per Month

One of Komashi’s core principles is to support small and early-stage businesses.

Every provider receives a **monthly free tier**:

- Up to **10 issued invoices per month**
- **No registration fee**
- **No monthly subscription fee**

This means that providers with low invoicing volume (for example, freelancers or small service businesses issuing only a few invoices per month) can use Komashi **completely free**, with no time limit.

**$0**  
Up to **10 invoices per month**

## 2. Tier-Based Pricing Above the Free Limit

If a provider exceeds the monthly free limit of 10 invoices, fees are calculated based on **annual revenue tiers**.

Important to note:
- The percentage fee applies **only to usage above the free tier**
- Fees decrease as annual revenue increases
- The pricing model scales with business growth

### Annual Revenue Tiers

| Annual Revenue (USD) | Total Fee (%) |
|---------------------|---------------|
| $0 – $150,000       | 5.50%         |
| $150,000 – $300,000 | 4.50%         |
| $300,000 – $1,500,000 | 3.60%       |
| $1,500,000 – $3,000,000 | 3.05%    |
| Above $3,000,000    | 2.60%         |

> The total fee includes both the **Komashi platform fee** and **partner commissions** paid through the Partner Program.

## What This Means for Providers

- Small providers can operate at **zero cost**
- Growing businesses benefit from **decreasing relative fees**
- No fixed costs — pricing is fully performance-based

This structure ensures that providers only pay when they grow and generate value through the platform.
