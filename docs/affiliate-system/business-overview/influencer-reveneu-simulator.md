# Influencer Revenue Simulator (Level 2)

The **Influencer Revenue Simulator** helps you estimate the **passive income** you can earn from partners you invite into the Komashi Partner Program.

This simulator focuses on **Level 2 revenues**, where your earnings come from the success of your invited partners and the providers they onboard.

## Who Is This Simulator For?

Use this simulator if:
- You invited **partners** (not providers directly)
- You want to understand long-term, **network-based income**
- You are building a scalable affiliate strategy

---

## How the Simulator Works

1. Enter the number of **partners you invited**.
2. For each partner, the simulator evaluates:
   - How many providers they brought in
   - The providers’ annual revenue
   - The Komashi fees generated above the free tier
3. Your **Level 2 commission** is calculated automatically based on the applicable revenue tiers.

You do not need to manage providers directly for Level 2 earnings.

## Understanding the Results

The simulator shows:
- Estimated commission generated by each partner
- Total passive income across your partner network

## Why Level 2 Income Is Powerful

Level 2 commissions are smaller percentages than Level 1, but they benefit from **network effects**:

- One active partner can bring multiple providers
- Multiple partners can multiply your reach
- Income scales without increasing your workload

As your partner network grows, Level 2 income can become your **largest and most stable revenue stream**.

- Which partners are the most valuable long-term
- How passive income compounds over time

The Influencer Revenue Simulator is designed to give you a clear, realistic picture of how network growth translates into sustainable passive income within the Komashi Partner Program.
