# Influencer Revenues (Level 2)

This guide explains how **Level 2 (Influencer) commissions** work and how you can earn **passive income** by building a partner network.

## What Are Level 2 Revenues?

The real strength of the Komashi Partner Program lies in **network effects**.

When you invite a **Partner** into the program:
- That partner becomes part of your **Level 1 network**
- You do not need to manage their providers directly

When your Level 1 partner invites **providers**:
- The partner earns their **Level 1 commission**
- You earn an additional **Level 2 commission** on top of their success

This income is completely **passive** for you.
