# Partner Revenue Simulator (Level 1)

The **Partner Revenue Simulator** helps you estimate how much commission you can earn from providers you **directly invite** using your referral code.

This simulator answers two key questions:
- How much will Komashi cost the provider?
- How much commission can you earn over the **next 3 years**?

---

## Who Is This Simulator For?

Use this simulator if:
- You invited the provider yourself (Level 1)
- You want to estimate **realistic earnings**, not theoretical maximums
- You want to compare different provider types and sizes

---

## How the Simulator Works

You start by selecting one or more **provider profiles** that resemble the businesses you plan to invite.

Each profile represents a typical company with:
- A specific business model
- Estimated annual revenue (USD)
- Invoice volume and billing frequency

The simulator then calculates:
- Whether the provider exceeds the free usage tier
- The Komashi fees the provider pays
- Your **Level 1 commission** based on those fees

---

## Free Tier Impact

Providers who stay within the **monthly free tier** (up to 10 invoices per month):

- Pay **$0** to Komashi
- Generate **no commission**
- Can still remain valuable long-term if they grow later

This is important when evaluating small or early-stage businesses.

---

## Commission Calculation Logic

For providers who exceed the free tier:

- Commissions are calculated **only on paid Komashi fees**
- Your commission percentage depends on the provider’s **annual revenue tier**
- Larger providers may have lower percentages but generate higher absolute earnings

The simulator applies these rules automatically.

---

## 3-Year Earnings Projection

The simulator shows:
- Estimated **annual commission**
- Total commission over **3 years**
- Clear separation between free usage and paid usage

This helps you understand:
- Short-term earning potential
- Medium-term recurring income
- Portfolio value over time

---

## What the Results Tell You

At the end of the simulation, you will see:
- Total combined provider revenue
- Your estimated **annual commission**
- Your projected **3-year earnings**

This makes it easier to:
- Prioritize which providers to target
- Set realistic income expectations
- Build a sustainable referral strategy

---

## Why This Matters

The Partner Revenue Simulator turns complex pricing and commission rules into **clear, understandable numbers**.

It is a planning tool—not a promise—but it gives you a reliable foundation for building your partner business on Komashi.
