# Partner Revenues (Level 1)

This guide explains how **Level 1 partner commissions** work and how much revenue you can earn from providers who register using your referral code.

---

## What Are Level 1 Revenues?

When a provider signs up using **your referral code**, they become part of your **Level 1 portfolio**.

You earn a **percentage-based commission** on every fee that provider pays to Komashi **above the free usage tier**.

- No commission is generated from free usage
- Commissions are calculated only on paid Komashi fees
- Earnings scale with the provider’s growth

---

## How Commission Is Calculated

Your commission rate depends on the **provider’s annual revenue**.

As providers grow:
- The **percentage rate decreases**
- The **revenue base increases**

This ensures fair pricing for large providers while still offering strong earning potential for partners.

## Level 1 Commission Tiers

| Provider Annual Revenue (USD) | Your Commission (L1) |
|------------------------------|----------------------|
| $0 – $150,000                | 2.50%                |
| $150,000 – $300,000          | 1.75%                |
| $300,000 – $1,500,000        | 1.40%                |
| $1,500,000 – $3,000,000      | 1.20%                |
| Above $3,000,000             | 1.00%                |

> The commission percentage applies to the **fees paid to Komashi**, not the provider’s full revenue.

## Commission Duration – 3 Years

You earn commissions from each referred provider for **3 years (36 months)** starting from their registration date.

- Predictable, medium-term recurring income
- After 3 years, commissions for that provider stop
- You can continuously add new providers to grow your earnings

---

## Monthly Payouts

- Commissions are calculated **monthly**
- Once a provider pays their Komashi fees, your commission is credited automatically
- You can track earnings and payment status in the **Payouts** section

This system ensures transparent, reliable, and scalable partner income.

Level 1 revenues reward you directly for bringing real value to the Komashi platform by onboarding active providers.
