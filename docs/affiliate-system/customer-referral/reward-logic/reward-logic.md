# Provider Fee Simulator

The **Provider Fee Simulator** helps you estimate how much it will cost a service provider to use Komashi based on their business model, pricing, and annual revenue.

This tool is especially useful when:
- You want to explain Komashi costs to a potential provider
- You want transparent, data-based numbers before onboarding
- You are planning referrals as a partner or influencer

---

## Step 1: Select a Representative Provider

Start by choosing a company profile that closely matches the provider you plan to invite  
(for example: a company with **~$300,000 annual revenue**).

The simulator represents a **realistic provider scenario**, including:
- Industry type
- Subscription-based services (monthly / yearly)
- Estimated sales volume

---

## Step 2: Review Provider Services and Revenue

The simulator breaks down revenue by services and billing cycles, such as:
- Monthly subscriptions
- Annual subscriptions
- Different service tiers (e.g. Basic, Premium)

For each service, you will see:
- Number of subscriptions
- Monthly and yearly pricing
- Total annual revenue contribution

All values are summarized into a **total annual revenue** figure.

---

## Step 3: Apply Free Tier and Pricing Tiers

The simulator automatically applies Komashi’s pricing rules:

### Free Tier
- The **first 10 invoices per month** are always free
- No setup fees or monthly subscription fees

### Tier-Based Fees
- Fees are calculated **only above the free tier**
- Percentage-based pricing is applied according to annual revenue brackets
- Higher revenue results in **lower relative fees**

---

## Step 4: Cost Breakdown

The simulator shows:
- Revenue falling into each pricing tier
- The applied percentage fee per tier
- Total Komashi cost per year
- Average monthly cost
- Effective percentage compared to total revenue

This makes it easy to see the **real cost impact**, not just headline percentages.

---

## Long-Term View

The simulator also highlights how costs change over time:
- Partner commissions are included in the fee calculation
- After **3 years**, partner-related costs decrease
- This can significantly reduce the provider’s effective fee rate

---

## Why Use the Simulator?

- Clear and transparent pricing explanation
- Helps overcome pricing objections
- Builds trust with potential providers
- Supports data-driven sales conversations

The Provider Fee Simulator is designed to make Komashi pricing easy to understand for both partners and providers.
