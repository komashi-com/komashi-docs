# Getting Started with the Komashi Partner Program

Welcome to the Komashi Partner Program.  
This guide explains how the program works, how referrals and commissions are calculated, and how you can use built-in simulators to plan your earnings.

---

## How the Partner Program Works

The Komashi Partner Program is a **multi-level referral system** designed to reward both direct and indirect referrals.

You can earn commissions by:
- Inviting **service providers** to use Komashi
- Inviting **other partners**, who then bring providers into the platform

---

## Roles and Levels

### Provider
A provider is a company or individual that uses the Komashi billing platform to manage subscriptions, invoices, and payments.

### Partner (Level 1)
As a partner, you earn commissions from providers you **directly invite** to Komashi.

### Influencer (Level 2)
As an influencer, you earn **passive commissions** from partners you invite, when their referred providers generate revenue.

This structure allows you to build long-term income through both direct sales and network growth.

---

## Referral Code System

Every partner has a **unique referral code**.

- Providers must enter this code during registration
- The system automatically assigns them to you
- Commissions are tracked without any manual action

Example referral code:
5KOMASHI

You can change your referral code **once per year** in the **Referral Code Management** section.

## Earnings Simulators

To help you make informed decisions, Komashi provides multiple simulators that show costs and potential earnings from different perspectives.

### Provider Simulator
Shows how much a provider pays after:
- The free usage tier
- Tier-based pricing rules

Useful for explaining costs to potential customers.

---

### Partner Simulator
Calculates how much commission you earn from providers you personally referred.

Ideal for estimating your **direct income**.

---

### Influencer Simulator
Estimates passive income generated by partners you invited and their referred providers.

Helps you understand the long-term value of growing your network.

---

## Commission Duration – The 3-Year Rule

Commissions are paid for **3 years** starting from the provider’s registration date.

- After 3 years, commissions for that provider stop
- You can continue earning by adding new providers and partners

This model encourages continuous growth rather than one-time referrals.

---

## Payouts and Withdrawals

- Commissions can be requested **once per month**
- A minimum payout amount must be reached
- Billing details must be completed before requesting a payout

Once these conditions are met, your earnings can be withdrawn to your selected payout method.

The Komashi Partner Program is built for scalability, transparency, and predictable long-term rewards.
