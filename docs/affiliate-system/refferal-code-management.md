## Important Notes

- After changing your referral code, **all previously invited partners and providers** will automatically be linked to the new code
- The referral code can be changed **once per year**
- If the code is already in use, the system will not allow the change

Choose your referral code carefully, as it represents your identity within the Partner Program.
