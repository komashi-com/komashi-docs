# Payment Validation

To complete the validation process, you will need a **bank card**.

During validation, the system uses **Stripe** to perform a card authentication:

- A temporary charge of **€1** will be made to your bank card
- This charge is used **only for card verification**
- The amount is not a fee and may be refunded depending on your bank

This validation step is required to ensure secure payment processing and to activate payment-related features on your account.
